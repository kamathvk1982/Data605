## Problem set 1   
  
Choose independently two numbers B and C at random from the interval [0, 1] with uniform density. Prove that B and C are proper probability distributions.  

Note that the point (B,C) is then chosen at random in the unit square.  

Find the probability that
  
(a) B + C < 1/2  
    
    B + C = 1 passes through the points (1/2, 0) and (0, 1/2).

    ==> B + C < 1 is the area  of the triangle formed in the unit square and the half plane B + C < 0.5
    
    ==> So, P(B + C) = (Area of triangle with vertices (1/2, 0), (0, 1/2), (0, 0)) 
    
    ==>  (1/2) * (1/2)(1/2)  =  ***1/8***

(b) BC < 1/2  
    
    ==> P(BC < 1/2) 
    
    ==> ∫(x = 1/2 to 1) dx/(2x)  =  ***(1/2) ln 2***
    
---    

(c) |B − C| < 1/2  
    
    ==> P(B >= 1/2 + C, C < 1/2 ) + P(C >= 1/2 + B, B < 1/2 )
    
    ==> P(B > 1/2 , C < 1/2) **+** P(C > 1/2, B < 1/2)
    
    ==> B < 1/2 or B > 1/2 occurs half the time, so the probability is 1/2 
    
    ==> C < 1/2 or C > 1/2 occurs half the time, so the probability is 1/2
    
    ==> 1/2  **+**  1/2  =  ***1/4***

(d) max{B,C} < 1/2  

    ==> Means P(B < 1/2) **and** P(C < 1/2)  
    
    ==> B < 1/2 occurs half the time, so the probability is 1/2 
    
    ==> C < 1/2 occurs half the time, so the probability is 1/2
    
    ==>   1/2 x 1/2 = ***1/4***

---    

(e) min{B,C} < 1/2  

    ==> Means P(B < 1/2) **or** P(C < 1/2)  
    
    ==> B < 1/2 occurs half the time, so the probability is 1/2 
    
    ==> C < 1/2 occurs half the time, so the probability is 1/2
  
    ==> 1/2 or 1/2 = ***1/2***
