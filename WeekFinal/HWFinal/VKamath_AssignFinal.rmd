11. A company buys 100 lightbulbs, each of which has an exponential lifetime of 1000 hours. What is the expected time for the first of these bulbs to burn out?

    ***==> Solution:***
    
    E[Xi] = 1 / λi = 1000
    
    Expected lifetime of a bulb is 1000 hours.
    
    λi = 1 / 1000
    
    Xi is exponential so
    
    min{X1,X2,...,X100} ∼ exponential (∑ i=1 to 100 for λi)
    
    E[min Xi] = 1/ (1/10) = 10
    
    
    **==> Expected time for the first of these bulbs to burn out is 10 hours**

14. Assume that X1 and X2 are independent random variables, each having an exponential density with parameter λ. Show that Z=X1−X2 has density  
  
$fZ(z)=(1/2)λe−λ|z|$
    
***==> Solution:***

1. Let X be a continuous random variable with mean μ=10 and variance σ2=100/3. Using Chebyshev’s Inequality, find an upper bound for the following probabilities. 

    a. P(|X−10|≥2)  
        ```{r}
        var <- 100/3
        e <- 2
        p <- var / e^2
        paste0('Upper bound is ', round(p, 4))
        ```
    
    b. P(|X−10|≥5)   
        ```{r}
        var <- 100/3
        e <- 5
        p <- var / e^2
        paste0('Upper bound is ', round(p, 4))
        ```
    
    c. P(|X−10|≥9)    
        ```{r}
        var <- 100/3
        e <- 9
        p <- var / e^2
        paste0('Upper bound is ', round(p, 4))
        ```
    
    d. (|X−10|≥20)    
        ```{r}
        var <- 100/3
        e <- 20
        p <- var / e^2
        paste0('Upper bound is ', round(p, 4))
        ```
