### Functions of Several Variables
  
### Exercise 12.1 #17

In Exercises 15 – 22, describe in words and sketch the level curves for the function and given c values.

\[ f(x,y) = x - y^2; c = -2; 0; 2 \]

==> 

Consider $c=0$. Then $f(x,y)= x - y^2 = c = 0$, so $y= ±\sqrt{x}$.  
With $c=−2$, $y=±\sqrt{x+2}$,   
and with $c=2$, $y=± \sqrt{x-2}$;   
  
so the intersection will have the same shape just shifted by 2.  

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
x <- seq(-10,30,0.05)
y <- seq(-10,10,0.05)
xy <- data.frame(expand.grid(x=x, y=y))
z <- xy$x-xy$y^2

f <- data.frame(xy, z)

ggplot(f, aes(x, y, z=z))+
  geom_raster(aes(fill=z))+
  geom_contour(breaks=c(-2,0,2), colour="white")+
  xlab("x")+ylab("y")

```
