## Problem set 1  

(1) Calculate the dot product u:v where u = [0.5; 0.5] and v = [3;-4]  
    ```{r}
    u <- matrix(c(0.5, 0.5), 1, 2)
    v <- matrix(c(3, -4), 1, 2)
    
    #print("dot product u:v is ")
    (0.5 *  3) + (0.5 * -4)
    ```   
    
    
(2) What are the lengths of u and v? Please note that the mathematical notion of the length of a vector is not the same as a computer science defnition.  
    ```{r}
    ulen <- sqrt(0.5**2 + 0.5**2)
    #print("lengths of u is ")
    ulen
    
    vlen <- sqrt(3**2 + (-4)**2 )
    #print("lengths of v is ")
    vlen
    ```  
    
(3) What is the linear combination: 3u - 2v?   
    ```{r}
    #print("linear combination: 3u - 2v is ")
    3*u - 2*v
    ```  
  

(4) What is the angle between u and v  
    ```{r}
    #print("angle between u and v is ")
    acos ( ( (0.5 *  3) + (0.5 * -4) )  / ( ulen  *  vlen  ) )
    ```

## Problem set 2  

(1) Set up a system of equations with 3 variables and 3 constraints and solve for x. Please
write a function in R that will take two variables (matrix A & constraint vector b) and
solve using elimination. Your function should produce the right answer for the system of
equations for any 3-variable, 3-equation system. You don't have to worry about degenerate
cases and can safely assume that the function will only be tested with a system of equations
that has a solution. Please note that you do have to worry about zero pivots, though. Please
note that you should not use the built-in function solve to solve this system or use matrix
inverses. The approach that you should employ is to construct an Upper Triangular Matrix
and then back-substitute to get the solution. Alternatively, you can augment the matrix
A with vector b and jointly apply the Gauss Jordan elimination procedure.Please test it with 
the system below and it should produce a solution x = [-1.55, -0.32, 0.95]

    solve_x = function(A, b){
      r <- dim(A)[1]
      c <- dim(A)[2]+dim(b)[2]
      
      UT <- matrix(c(A, b), nrow=r, ncol=c)
      
      for (j in 1:(c-2)) {
        for (i in (j+1):r) {
          UT[i,] <- UT[i,]-UT[j,]*UT[i,j]/UT[j,j]  
        }
      }
      
      UT[r,] <- UT[r,]/UT[r,r]
      xn <- numeric(r)
      xn[r] = UT[r,c]
      
      for (k in (r-1):1) {
        t = 0
        for (m in (k+1):r) {
          s = UT[k,m]*xn[m]
          t = t + s
        }
        xn[k] = (UT[k,c] - t) / UT[k,k]
      }
      
      x <- round(xn,2)
    
    return(x)
    
    }
    
    A <- matrix(c(1, 2, -1, 1, -1, -2, 3, 5, 4), nrow=3, ncol=3) 
    b <- matrix(c(1, 2, 6), nrow=3, ncol=1)
    solve_x(A,b)
