### Sequences and Series
  
### Exercise 8.8 #5   

Key Idea 8.8.1 gives the nth term of the Taylor series of common functions. In Exercises 3 – 6, verify the formula given in the Key Idea by finding the first few terms of the Taylor series of the given function and identifying pattern.

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{(1 - x)}; c = 0  \]

==> 

\[ f′(x)=\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2}\]  

\[ f′′(x)=f′(f′(x))=f′(\frac{1}{(1 - x)^2})=\frac{2}{(1−x)^3}\]  

\[ f′′′(x)=f′(f′′(x))=\frac{6}{(1−x)^4}\]  

\[ f′′′′(x)=f′(f′′′(x))=\frac{6∗4}{(1−x)^5}\]  

The series is bounded by $x[−1,1]$

#Loading required package: pracma

#Getting the taylor series
x = function(x) {1/(1-x)}

c = 0
n = 6

p <- taylor(x, c, n)
p
